# **App Name**: CryptoCompanion

## Core Features:

- Text Input: Provide an input field for users to enter plaintext or ciphertext.
- Algorithm Selection: Offer a dropdown menu or similar UI element to select encryption/decryption algorithms (Caesar, Vigenere, etc.).
- Key Input: Provide a field for users to enter the encryption/decryption key. The system should be able to call a tool for generating the keys.
- Encryption: Encrypt the given plain text, using the selected algorithm and entered key.
- Decryption: Decrypt the given cipher text, using the selected algorithm and entered key.
- Output Display: Display the encrypted or decrypted text in a clear and easy-to-read output area.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark, desaturated blue (#232931) for a professional feel.
- Primary color: Saturated blue (#6A7BC1) to provide a visually interesting contrast to the dark background.
- Accent color: A brighter analogous hue (#846AC1) to highlight key elements such as buttons or interactive components.
- Monospace font for text input and output to ensure consistent character spacing and readability, so: 'Source Code Pro', a monospaced sans-serif, is recommended.
- A clean, modular layout with clear separation between input fields, algorithm selection, and output display.
